1. What are MiddleWares?
-> It is an intermidiary

    Request --> [Middleware] --> Response

    a. in Express
        -> Middleware in express are functions that come into play After the server recieves the request and Before the responce is sent to the client

    b. common Middleware functions
        - methodOverride
        - bodyParser
        - express.static
        - express.urlencoded

    c. Properties
        - MW can access req and res Obj
        - chaining is possible (form one MW to another MW using next())
        - send a response -> they can send response directly from it to the client(res.send())

    d. What MW can do
        - execute any code
        - make changes in Req, Res obj
        - End the Req, Res cycle( by proving {res})
        - call next MW function in the stack (using next())

    e. work of MW
        - send responce
        - do {next}(what to do next) thing
    
        Can be
        - pathed(for special route)
            ex: app.use('/', (req, res)=> //code )
        - non-pathed(for all api routes)
            ex: app.use((req, res) => //code )
        ===They both will print what was on it but NOT specified what to do next()===
            ----loading...----
        
    f. using next()
        - next MW funtion is commonly denoted by 'next' name
        code:
            app.use((req, res, next)=>{
                console.log('hey biro');
                next()
            })

        - if current MW did not end the req-res cycle, it must call next() to pass the control to the next MW function

        NOTE: Do not write code after next()
    
    g. Create utility MW's
        - Logger(print usefull informations on console)
        code: 
            app.use((req, res, next)=>{
                res.restime = new Date(Date.now()).toString();
                console.log(req.method, req.path, req.resTime, req.hostname);
                next(); //passing the control to the next MW
            })
        
    h. exploring app.use()
        - we can check Authorized or not user using MW before accesing the API's
        - Write MW very end of the all api's
        code:
            app.use((req, res)=>{
                res.send('page not found');
            })
