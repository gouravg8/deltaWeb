As an aspirational Full-Stack developer this(React) is one of the thing that will help me to make Web Apps to solve real-life problems.

## Day1

Setup the project

npm create vite@latest
```

> Name [project-name]  
> Choose [React]  
> Choose [language(Javascript or Typescript)]

```bash
cd project-name     # to enter on project folder/directory
npm install         # install all needed dependencies
npm run dev         # run development server for react
```

git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git branch -M main
